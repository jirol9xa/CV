\textbf{\href{https://github.com/jirol9xa/MySTL} {My own STL structures} \hfill  March, 2023} \par
\begin{itemize}
The repository includes several structures that are an alternative to the standard containers presented in the STL. The repository is educational, so there is no semantic connection of some parts. Currently there is a version of std in the repository::vector and the unusual use of templates that do not belong to the STL.
